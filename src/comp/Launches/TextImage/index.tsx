          Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by
          SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into
          Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the worldâ€™s first orbital class
          reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive
          parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space
          access.
